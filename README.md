## Open Question
There are no clear requirements about use authentication/authorization. Therefore, based on the initial understanding of the requirements, it will be assumed that there is an identity provider that manages user logins.

***Items that are labeled as (out of scope) will not be included in the submitted solution, as there were no clear specifications or guidelines to propose a solution.***

## Personas

- Sign up (out of scope)
### Account User (Customer)
can:
- Browse Restaurants and Meals
- Rate Restaurants
- Order Meals
- Receive SMS Notification of place order

can:
- Browse Restaurants 
- Rate Restaurants **EXCEPT** theirs (cannot rate their own restaurants)
- Order Meals
- Create A Restaurant
- Add Meals to a restaurant they created
